# Move Your Sound - TouchDesigner

The **Move Your Sound** project aims to design instruments that can be played only **with the hands**, like theremins. \
This is an **open-source projec**t initially designed for a **Digital Creation school project at ECE Paris**, which is intended to evolve over time and with contributions from the community. \
The tools used can be as varied as TouchDesigner, MAX 8 or pure JUCE code - **the possibilities are endless**!
